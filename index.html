    <h2>How It Was Like & Looked</h2>
    <p>
      Back then, everything looked very busy and noisy. The streets were filled with smoke from factories and the sounds of machines clanking all day long. People wore simple clothes and worked hard from early morning till evening. The buildings were mostly made of brick with tall chimneys, and the air often smelled like coal and steam. It was a time of excitement and challenge, with a mix of old and new things everywhere.
